# Super-Snake
It is an enhanced version of Gluttonous Snake. Except for the original functions, it added checkpoints. It is a Stage Clear game with five stages.

There is a timer system for the gluttonous snake. The gluttonous snake would die if caught no food in specified time. The food would vanish if has not been eaten for a specified time. Besides, with the stages going up, different elements would appear like speed bump, portal, and man-machine snake.
